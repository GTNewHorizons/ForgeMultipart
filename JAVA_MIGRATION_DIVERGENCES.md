# Java migration divergence log

This log records intentional differences from the `1.7.12` reference implementation. Behavioral changes must be isolated from behavior-preserving conversions and justified here.

## 2026-08-14 — IDWriter Java pilot

### Observable behavior

No known behavior divergence. Byte, unsigned-short, and integer carrier selection and encoding remain identical, including the reference behavior that negative maximum values select the byte carrier.

### Supported JVM API

- Preserved `write()`, `write_$eq(Function2)`, `read()`, `read_$eq(Function1)`, `setMax(int)`, and the public constructor with their reference JVM descriptors.
- Marked the four Scala function property methods deprecated.
- Added `write(MCDataOutput, int)` and `read(MCDataInput)` as the Java-native API. Recompiled Scala callers also resolve to these methods.

### Compiler artifacts

Accepted divergence: the six public-but-generated `IDWriter$$anonfun$setMax$1` through `$6` classes are removed and replaced by private Java anonymous helper classes. They represented closure implementation details, were not named by source callers, and are not retained as supported API.

### Validation

- Existing `IDWriterCharacterizationTest`: 8 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- Complete plain-JVM suite: 25 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- Clean `checkstyleTest build`: passing.
- Java 8 Forge dedicated-server suite: 2 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- `IDWriter` class-file version: 52 (Java 8).
